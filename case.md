# Historical development

(1821)- Charles Babbage's difference engine Charles Babbage first announced the invention of the difference engine in his first calculating paper on 14 June 1822, with about 2000 parts the difference engine number 1 was built by his engineer and master toolmaker joseph clement and completed in 1832 this finished portion of the unfinished engine is only one seventh of the complete design. Difference engine Num 2 between 1847 and 1849 Babbage designed a new engine which benefitted from the techniques developed for the more demanding analytical engine the design was more efficient, requiring one third the number of parts of the first difference engine. 

(1936)- computer science and machine learning can be traced back to ideas and early protocols such as Babbage's calculating engine in the early 19th century or Hollerith's punch card system from the end of the 19th century there is however a strong case that Alan Turings machine laid the foundation for the development of computer science and machine learning in 1936 Alan Turing invented a mathematical model of a universal machine, which later became known as a Turing machine despite how simple it was the Turing machine can be constructed to solve and given computer algorithm in this wat this was the first concept of a universal all-purpose computing machine it provide computer science with a firm  scientific foundation, since it offers a model of computation which can be tested against real world applications.

(1945)- in 1942 john Mauchly proposed an all-electronic calculating machine, the result was ENIAC (electronic numerical integrator and computer) built between 1943 and 1945 the first large scale computer to run at electronic speed without being slowed by any mechanical parts. For a decade until a 1955 lightning strike ENIAC may have run more calculations that all mankind had done up to that point, much less well known are the six women who programmed ENIAC and truly brought it to life these women are Betty Holberton, Jean Jennings Bartik, kay McNulty ,Marlyn Wescoff Meltzer, Ruth Lichterman and Frances Bilas Spencer. 

(1947)- The digital revolution began in 1947 with the invention of the solid-state transistor. John Bardeen, Walter Brattain and William Shockley, working for bell labs in the USA developed the revolutionary semiconductor device which can act as a switch turning tiny electric currents on or off, and as an amplifier of electric currents this could perform the same functions as vacuum tubes but was much smaller, more reliable and energy efficient, the impact of the transistor was immediate and far reaching it allowed for the creation of smaller more reliable electronic devices(the transistor radio). 

(1957)- integrated circuit the idea of the integrated circuit came around in about 1957 when the idea of creating small, ceramic wafers that each contained one component was first proposed by jack Kilby who worked for the us army his idea led to the micromodule program which held quite a bit of promise however as the project gained traction Kilby came up with another more advanced design that became the Integrated Circuit(IC) on September 12th 1958 Kilby demonstrated the first working IC and applied for a patent on February 6th 1959 Kilby's description of the device being a work of an electronic circuit was, for his part in inventing the IC Kilby won the Nobel prize in 2000. 

(1989)- The world wide web also known as WWW has reshaped human communication and made it possible to access vast amounts of information from any connected device from anywhere in the world the world wide web began in 1989 when British computer scientist sir Tim Berners less proposed a system to share information across different computers in 1990 Tim Berners lee received permission to develop the web further creating foundational technologies like html (Hypertext Markup Language), HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and URL (Uniform Resource Locator) the web has revolutionised our daily lives, in terms of how we interact, learn, conduct business and engage with society this also improved and revolutionised communication with email,social media and instant messaging making getting a message to someone nearly instantaneously compared to what it wouldve been years ago during the world wars and even going back to the 80s that just shows how within a couple years how much humans have advanced. 

(2019)- Quantum supremacy in 2019 google claimed to have achieved quantum supremacy demonstrating that a quantum computer could perform a specific task faster than the most powerful classical computers this milestone highlighted the power of quantum computing for solving specific types of problems, quantum error correction advancements researchers  have made significant progress in quantum error correction developing new methods for detecting and fixing errors in quantum systems that is a vital step toward creating fault tolerance quantum computers the future of quantum computing research the future of quantum computing is very promising because as it is improving researchers are focusing on developing quantum software and practical applications, from drug discovery to financial modelling and optimization problems.
