###Historical development

(1821)- Charles Babbage's difference engine Charles Babbage first announced the invention of the difference engine in his first calculating paper on 14 June 1822, with about 2000 parts the difference engine number 1 was built by his engineer and master toolmaker joseph clement and completed in 1832 this finished portion of the unfinished engine is only one seventh of the complete design. Difference engine Num 2 between 1847 and 1849 Babbage designed a new engine which benefitted from the techniques developed for the more demanding analytical engine the design was more efficient, requiring one third the number of parts of the first difference engine.
