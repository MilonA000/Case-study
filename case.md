# Historical development

(1821)- Charles Babbage's difference engine Charles Babbage first announced the invention of the difference engine in his first calculating paper on 14 June 1822, with about 2000 parts the difference engine number 1 was built by his engineer and master toolmaker joseph clement and completed in 1832 this finished portion of the unfinished engine is only one seventh of the complete design. Difference engine Num 2 between 1847 and 1849 Babbage designed a new engine which benefitted from the techniques developed for the more demanding analytical engine the design was more efficient, requiring one third the number of parts of the first difference engine. 

(1945)- in 1942 john Mauchly proposed an all-electronic calculating machine, the result was ENIAC (electronic numerical integrator and computer) built between 1943 and 1945 the first large scale computer to run at electronic speed without being slowed by any mechanical parts. For a decade until a 1955 lightning strike ENIAC may have run more calculations that all mankind had done up to that point, much less well known are the six women who programmed ENIAC and truly brought it to life these women are Betty Holberton, Jean Jennings Bartik, kay McNulty ,Marlyn Wescoff Meltzer, Ruth Lichterman and Frances Bilas Spencer. 

(1947)- The digital revolution began in 1947 with the invention of the solid-state transistor. John Bardeen, Walter Brattain and William Shockley, working for bell labs in the USA developed the revolutionary semiconductor device which can act as a switch turning tiny electric currents on or off, and as an amplifier of electric currents this could perform the same functions as vacuum tubes but was much smaller, more reliable and energy efficient, the impact of the transistor was immediate and far reaching it allowed for the creation of smaller more reliable electronic devices(the transistor radio). 

(1957)- integrated circuit the idea of the integrated circuit came around in about 1957 when the idea of creating small, ceramic wafers that each contained one component was first proposed by jack Kilby who worked for the us army his idea led to the micromodule program which held quite a bit of promise however as the project gained traction Kilby came up with another more advanced design that became the Integrated Circuit(IC) on September 12th 1958 Kilby demonstrated the first working IC and applied for a patent on February 6th 1959 Kilby's description of the device being a work of an electronic circuit was, for his part in inventing the IC Kilby won the Nobel prize in 2000.
